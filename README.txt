In this program, I built a backend consisting of the ekreb game – 
I provide functinonality for playing the game in two languages – Spanish and English, allowing the user to select between two different languages and
3 different difficulty levels. 

It imports API's from merriam webster dictionary for official hint definitions, and it also imports random words from APIs in both english and spanish.
